## **🛠 Installation**
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Anshuman22code/NIT_ROURKELA_GAN.git
cd HighQualityImageSynthesis
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Set Up Datasets**
#### **(a) Foreground Extraction Data**
Download and place `input_lowres.zip` and `trimap_lowres.zip` in `data/alphamatting/`, then extract them.

#### **(b) Super-Resolution Data**
Download **100+ high-resolution images** for SRGAN:  
```sh
python automatic_hrdwnld.py
```

#### **(c) Background Dataset for CGAN**
Download background images manually or use the **Pexels API**:
```sh
python download_backgrounds.py
```

## **🖥️ Training**
### **1️⃣ Train MODNet (Foreground Extraction)**
```sh
python scripts/train_modnet.py
```
🔹 The trained model is saved in: **`checkpoints/modnet.pth`**

### **2️⃣ Train Conditional GAN (Background Synthesis)**
```sh
python scripts/train_cgan.py
```
🔹 The trained model is saved in: **`checkpoints/cgan.pth`**

### **3️⃣ Train SRGAN (Super-Resolution)**
```sh
python scripts/train_srgan.py
```
🔹 The trained model is saved in: **`checkpoints/srgan.pth`**

---

## **🎮 Usage**
After training, you can **test the models** using:
```sh
python main.py
```
This will generate **high-quality images** using the trained models.

---

## **📝 Notes**
- Ensure **datasets are properly placed** before training.  
- **GPU acceleration** (CUDA) is recommended for faster training.  
- Adjust hyperparameters in `train_*.py` for better results.
